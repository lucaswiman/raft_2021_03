# traffic.py
#
# Implement traffic light control software.  
#
# Challenge: Can you do it with NO dependencies on any runtime environment.
# No threads, no clock, no sockets, no "system" or "runtime" dependencies.
#
# Pure logic/algorithm. Nothing else.
#
# Motivation:  Make something that can be tested/debugged. Debugging
# with threads/sockets is a nightmare.
